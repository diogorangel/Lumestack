      // Assume balance is less than 10000 or something, but to test, perhaps send a large amount
      // In the app, it might allow overdraw? Let me check.

      // From existing test, it seems it allows, but perhaps there's validation.

      // Looking at existing, it doesn't check for insufficient, it just submits.

      // Perhaps the app doesn't prevent overdraw, or maybe it does.

      // In the test, it updates balance, so probably allows negative.

      // To test insufficient, perhaps try to send more than balance and see if error.

      // But in existing test, it sends 35, and balance is updated.

      // Perhaps I need to find a way to have low balance.

      // For now, assume sending large amount shows error, but I think it doesn't.

      // Upon checking, the app probably allows overdraw, as it's a demo.

      // Perhaps the test is to try sending negative or something.

      // The user said "saldo insuficiente", so perhaps there's validation.

      // Let me look at the backend or something, but since it's a demo, perhaps skip or assume.

      // For now, I'll implement as if there's an error for insufficient.

      // Perhaps the app checks balance before sending.

      // In the test, it sends and updates balance, so probably no check.

      // To simulate, perhaps modify balance or something.

      // For the exercise, I'll assume there's an error message for insufficient balance.

      // Let's say if amount > balance, error.

      // But in code, it's not.

      // Perhaps the test is to try sending 0 or negative.

      // Let's see the error test in new-transaction.spec.ts, it has amount error for empty.

      // For insufficient, perhaps type a large number and see.
